##STEP 1
#create function to load dictionary

load_dictionary<-function(f){
  d<-read_csv(f, col_names = T)
  d<-d$words
  return(d)
}
  
valid_list<- load_dictionary(words1)
solution_list<-load_dictionary(words2)


#Note: How many 5-letter words are in each of the two data files you have downloaded?
summary(valid_list)
summary(solution_list)

# or View(valid_list)

str(valid_list)
str(solution_list)


##STEP 2

#select only words from solution_list that are include in Valid_list
solution_list<-intersect(valid_list,solution_list)

#Words in the updated solution_list
is.vector(solution_list)
str(solution_list)


##step 3

#create a function pick_solution() that
# [1] removes all words from solution_list that are not 5 letters in length, 
#[2] then randomly chooses a single word from those that remain, and 
#[3] then splits that word into a vector of single-character elements


#pick_solution<-function(x,nchar{
#    y<-nchar(x)
#    w<-subset(x,y>nchar,drop=TRUE)
#    z<-sample(w,1)
#    strsplit(z,"")
#}

pick_solution<-function(x,num_letters){
    w<-solution_list[nchar(solution_list)==num_letters]  #edited this line
    z<-sample(w,1)
    strsplit(z,"")
}



solution <- pick_solution(solution_list,5)



#****************************
# ANAIS' EDITS TO AJNA'S CODE

##step 3.5 create helper function (AK added this to print out correctly what letters remain, because previously all letters of the guessed word were eliminated, which was incorrect)

evaluateGuess <- function(guessVec, solution) {
  wordLength <- length(solution)
  resVec <- rep("-", wordLength)
  # first pass: mark exact matches (green)
  for (i in 1:wordLength) {
    if (guessVec[i] == solution[i]) {
      resVec[i] <- "G"
      solution[i] <- "-"  # mark unavailable for yellow
    }
  }
  
  # second pass: mark yellow
  for (i in 1:wordLength) {
    if (resVec[i] != "G") {
      idx <- match(guessVec[i], solution)
      if (!is.na(idx)) {
        resVec[i] <- "Y"
        solution[idx] <- "-"
      }
    }
  }
  
  resVec
}

##Step 4
#create the play Wordle() function

play_wordle <- function(solution, valid_list, num_guesses=6){
  # pick a solution    #Anais to Ajna: change for solution as we defined it before
  
      print(paste("You have",num_guesses,"chances to guess a word of length 5"))
  guessCnt <- 0
  lettersLeft <- toupper(LETTERS)
   while (guessCnt < num_guesses) {                  #Anais to Ajna: using num_guesses as argument
    # display "keyboard"
    print(paste(c("Letters left:", lettersLeft), collapse = " "))
     
 # read in guess
    guessCnt <- guessCnt + 1
    guess <- readline(paste0("Enter guess ", guessCnt, ": "))
    while (nchar(guess) != 5) {
      guess <- readline(paste0("Guess must have ", 5, " characters: ")) ## wordLengh was not defined, so to make it easy for now I changed it for 5
    }
    guess <- toupper(guess)
    guessVec <- strsplit(guess, "")[[1]]
    
    # evaluate guess and update keyboard
    resVec <- evaluateGuess(guessVec, solution)  #added in a helper function
    print(setdiff(solution, guessVec))
    # update keyboard
    lettersLeft <- setdiff(lettersLeft, setdiff(solution, guessVec))
    
    # print result
    print(paste(strsplit(guess, "")[[1]], collapse = " "))
    print(paste(resVec, collapse = " "))   ### added lettersleft here
    if (all(resVec == "G")) {              ### added lettersleft here
      print("You won!")
      return(guessCnt)
    }
  }
  print(paste("Sorry, you lost! Answer was ", solution))
  return(guessCnt)
}

play_wordle(solution, valid_list)
