```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```



```{r wordle}

words1<-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajnafkertesz/ada-2022-datasets/main/collins-scrabble-words-2019.txt"


words2<-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajnafkertesz/ada-2022-datasets/main/google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt"


##STEP 1
#create function to load dictionary

load_dictionary<-function(f){
  d<-read_csv(f, col_names = T)
  d<-d$words
  return(d)
}
  
valid_list<- load_dictionary(words1)
solution_list<-load_dictionary(words2)


#Note: How many 5-letter words are in each of the two data files you have downloaded?
summary(valid_list)
summary(solution_list)

# or View(valid_list)

str(valid_list)
str(solution_list)


##STEP 2

#select only words from solution_list that are include in Valid_list
solution_list<-intersect(valid_list,solution_list)

#Words in the updated solution_list
is.vector(solution_list)
str(solution_list)


##step 3

#create a function pick_solution() that
# [1] removes all words from solution_list that are not 5 letters in length, 
#[2] then randomly chooses a single word from those that remain, and 
#[3] then splits that word into a vector of single-character elements


pick_solution<-function(x,nchar){
    y<-nchar(x)
    w<-subset(x,y>nchar,drop=TRUE)
    z<-sample(w,1)
    strsplit(z,"")
}

solution <- pick_solution(solution_list,5)
solution



##Step 4
#create the play Wordle() function

play_wordle <- function(solution, valid_list, num_guesses=6){
      print(paste("You have",num_guesses,"chances to guess a word of length 5"))
    }
