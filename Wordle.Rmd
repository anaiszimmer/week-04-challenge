##STEP 1
#create function to load dictionary

load_dictionary<-function(f){
  d<-read_csv(f, col_names = T)
  d<-d$words
  return(d)
}
  
valid_list<- load_dictionary(words1)
solution_list<-load_dictionary(words2)


#Note: How many 5-letter words are in each of the two data files you have downloaded?
summary(valid_list)
summary(solution_list)

# or View(valid_list)

str(valid_list)
str(solution_list)


##STEP 2

#select only words from solution_list that are include in Valid_list
solution_list<-intersect(valid_list,solution_list)

#Words in the updated solution_list
is.vector(solution_list)
str(solution_list)


##step 3

#create a function that
# [1] removes all words from solution_list that are not 5 letters in length, 
#[2] then randomly chooses a single word from those that remain, and 
#[3] then splits that word into a vector of single-character elements
